The fully powered by typescript terminal-based OS usable in Web, is coming out soon. Best part is its free. For life. More information about kodakOS L is releasing soon, and on launch special launch party commands will be introduced. One will be revealed right now, superuser -party.
# How?
Using typescript, it's possible. When I get a computer, kodakOS will be usuable for FREE on Desktops. Maybe even a mobile app? Well, you need a TS server and I reccomend using replit for only YOUR needs. kodakOS is meant for a web-based type thing inspired by Linux by Linus. Different versions of kodakOS will be developed. During the other developments, kodakOS L will probably lose support from me.
