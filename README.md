The fully powered by typescript terminal-based OS usable in Web, is coming out soon. Best part is its free. For life. More information about kodakOS L is releasing soon, and on launch special launch party commands will be introduced. One will be revealed right now, superuser -party.
# Development Logs
## Feburary 14th almost Feb 15th.
Yooo! Whats up? Decided to do a little bit of a devlog but I got a mockup working in CoffeeScript, it has 2 commands and sadly takes 2-8 seconds to load the whole Terminal OS because of me using request lol. Anyways I wanna say it's going good and might be able to release a build very soon. Just uh, won't be as good. Still haven't added flags, might work on that. Like for example I could do, upgrade --force to force user to the github page IF they need an upgrade. I hope you enjoyed todays devlog, might make a development video on my channel https://www.youtube.com/@NamedTech let me know if you guys wanna see new features.
# How?
Using coffeescript, it's possible. When I get a computer, kodakOS will be usuable for FREE on Desktops. Maybe even a mobile app? Well, you need a CS server and I reccomend using replit for only YOUR needs. kodakOS is meant for a web-based type thing inspired by Linux by Linus. Different versions of kodakOS will be developed. During the other developments, kodakOS L will probably lose support from me.
# Deploy
very soon ;)

kodakOS isn't really an OS, its just a terminal. I'd like to call it an terminal-based OS. :) kodakOS. @ 2024 uarcell@proton.me
